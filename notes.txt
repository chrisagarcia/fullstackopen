npm create vite@latest [app-name] -- --template react

-> creates a react application

cd [app-name]
npm install
npm run dev

-> starts application on localhost:5173

const App = () => {...}

-> React components must be defined with a capital

-> React components must have a root element but we can sub <div></div> with fragments: <></>
    that do not render as an outer div

-> Do not render objects
